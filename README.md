# Bot Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project is designed to monitor and analyze the performance of robotic systems used in warehouse automation. It simulates bot performance data, analyzes key performance indicators (such as speed and error rate), and automatically creates defect tickets via Jira if performance issues are detected.

## Key Features
- **Performance Tracking**: Simulated bot data for analysis.
- **Defect Detection**: Flags bots with error rates exceeding 4%.
- **Jira Integration**: Automates defect ticket creation using Jira's REST API.
- **Logging**: Detailed logging for traceability and debugging.

## Setup & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
